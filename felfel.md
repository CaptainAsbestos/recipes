\section{Preparation}

\large

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Brush olive oil on the skins of the peppers, then roast them at 400°\textsc{f} in the oven for 35-40 minutes. Flip them over at halfway through. 
    \item Remove the peppers from the oven and place in an airtight container. This should "choke" the peppers, and facilitate removing the stems and seeds. 
    \item Cut an X on to each pole of the tomatos, and then boil them in water. The hatches should make it so they automatically peel themselves. Remove from the water when this is accomplished.
    \item Cut out the stems from the peppers and abrade the seeds from the inside.
    \item Dice the tomatos, onions, and peppers. Mince the garlic.
    \item Sauté the onions and garlic in oil over medium heat. Add the roast peppers, and then the tomatos. Stew the veggies in the sauce until the water evaporates. 
    \item If desired, fry eggs in wells created in the pan. Serve cold with bread.
\end{enumerate}
