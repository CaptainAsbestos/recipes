# \centering\sc\sffamily\huge Crawfish Étoufée 

Original recipe by Paul Proudhomme, modified a bit: https://www.magicseasoningblends.com/recipes/shrimp-or-crawfish-etouffee-stew/

Time from start to serve: 2 hours minimum. Serves 8. Best to make this with a cast iron skillet.

The proportions for the non-spice ingredients are forgiving, so don't stress. The roux and broth will start out as very bitter but should mellow out with low-simmering and frequent stirring. Don't add salt until the very end if you really need it.

\subsection{\sffamily\Large Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
\item \sfrac{1}{4} cup chopped onions
\item \sfrac{1}{4} cup chopped celery
\item \sfrac{1}{4} cup chopped bell pepper
\item 7 tablespoons oil
\item \sfrac{3}{4} cup flour
\item 3 cups seafood stock or chicken stock (or both!)
\item 2 sticks unsalted butter
\item 2 pounds uncooked crawfish
\item green onions
\item rice
\item Spice blend:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \sfrac{1}{2} teaspoon cayenne
        \item \sfrac{1}{2} teaspoon black pepper
        \item \sfrac{1}{2} teaspoon white pepper
        \item 1 teaspoon thyme
        \item 1 teaspoon dried basil
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\sffamily\Large Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Prepare your rice in a separate rice cooker or pot; let it cook as you work on the rest.
\item Peel crawfish and use shells to make stock with \textit{two} cups of water. Bring to boil on high heat.
\item Make a roux with the flour and oil on a cast iron skillet, aiming for a chocolate brown color. Add the cajun trinity veggies and immediately turn off the heat. Stir to coat the veggies with the roux. Let rest for five minutes.
\item One the veggie are done cooling, add them to the stock. Reduce the stock's heat to low, and whisk constantly for 2 minutes until flour taste is gone. Add the spice blend.
\item Melt a stick of butter in a separate pan. Sauté the crawfish and green onions for 1 minute. Add another stick of butter and \textit{one} cup of seafood stock to deglaze the pan, letting it stew for 4-6 minutes. If the sauce starts to separate, add more stock and shake the pan until it combines.
\item Serve over rice.
