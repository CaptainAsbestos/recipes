# Brennan's Bananas Foster

Famous fruit desert from a [French Quarter Institution](https://www.brennansneworleans.com/recipes/bananas-foster/)

## Ingredients 

- 1 ounce butter
- 0.5 Cup Brown Sugar
- 0.25 Tsp Cinnamon
- 1.5 oz Banana Liqueur or Creme de Banane
- 1.5 oz Dark Rum
- 1/2 Banana per person

Optional:

- One half orange, juiced
- Chopped pecans
- 0.5 Tsp Nutmeg, freshly ground

## Preparation

1. Peel and slice bananas.
2. Combine butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a flambe pan or wok. Melt the butter on ***medium heat***.
    * If so desired, add the pecans at this stage to get them nice and toasted. 
3. As the butter melt, add the banana liquor to stabilise the temperature at alcohol's boiling point. Stir to combine.
4. As the sauce starts to cook, add the bananas.
5. Cook the fruit until they soften (ca. 60-120 seconds).
6. Tilt the pan back to slightly heat the far edge. Once hot, carefully add the rum, tilting the pan towards the flame to ignite the rum.
7. Stir the sauce to ensure that all of the alcohol cooks out.
    * Add the orange juice at this stage if so desired. 
8. Serve the sauce and fruit over vanilla ice cream.
    * Grind fresh Nutmeg over the top for some extra kick.

Serve with coffee, preferably chicory coffee in true New Orleans style.
