# 1758 Curry Recipe

Saut√© chicken cutlets with onions in butter. When the meat browns, add a quarter ounce of turmeric, a large spoonful of ginger, and "beaten Pepper" (either diced bell peppers or black pepper -- both sound nice!). Coat the meat in the spices, add in some chicken stock, and let it stew for half an hour.

Add in a quarter pint of cream, juice of two lemons, and serve. Over rice, presumably?
