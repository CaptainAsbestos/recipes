\section{Ingredients} 

\subsection{For Biscuits}

\begin{itemize}

\item 2 cups flour (250 g)
\item 1 tablespoon baking powder 
\item 1 teaspoon salt 
\item 1 stick cold Imperial Vegetable Oil spread (meant as a substitute for $\sfrac{1}{3}$ cup oil)
\item $\sfrac{2}{3}$ cup oatmilk, unsweetened 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{For Gravy}

Eyeball the proportions in your cast iron pan. Use less flour than you think, because it puffs up when the milk is added.

\begin{itemize}

\item Flour 
\item Oatmilk
\item Vegetable Oil
\item Garlic Powder
\item Celery Salt
\item Onion Powder
\item White Pepper 
\item Fennel Seeds 
\item Vegan ground beef substitute (optional)

\end{itemize}

\section{Preparation}

Finish preparing the biscuits first, then make the gravy while they bake. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

\subsection{Biscuits}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. 
\item Add veggie oil spread and mix it until crumbly. 
\item Add oatmilk, mix until it's combined into a wet dough.
\item Flour a surface and flatten dough on it. Knead the dough through itself five times. At the end, flatten it to half-inch thick slab. 
\item Cut biscuits using a cup. Fold remainders into a pile and repeat. 
\item Place biscuits on parchment paper in oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes. Brush melted veggie spread on the surface if you want. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Gravy}

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Heat vegetable oil in cast iron. 
\item  Add flour. Stir constantly to make a blonde roux. 
\item  Add seasonings to the roux.
\item  When the seasonings become fragrant, add oatmilk. Stir constantly.
\item  Microwave the vegan meat and add to gravy, if desired.
\item  Serve the gravy over biscuits fresh out the oven.

\end{enumerate}
