# Lasagna Bolognese

Serves 6, prep time 1 hour (with as much sitting and waiting as you can tolerate -- I'd say up to 6 hours)

## Ingredients

For The Sauce:

- Tomatoes
- Onions
- Carrots (optional)
- Celery (optional)
- Mushrooms (Optional)
- Bay leaves
- Garlic
- The Spices
    * Oregano
    * Thyme
    * Parsley
    * Paprika
    * Cayenne
- Chicken Stock
- Red Wine
- Basil
- Olive Oil
- Italian Sausage

For the casserole:

- Mozzarella Cheese
- Zuchinni or Lasagna Pasta
- Ricotta Cheese
- 1 Egg
- Parmesan Cheese

## Preparation

1. The sausages work best if slightly frozen; frozen ragù can also speed up the recipe. Slice the meat into squat cylinders and let thaw.
2. Prepare the sauce (see the ragù recipe elsewhere). Get some water boiling and blanch the tomatoes when at a rolling boil, making sure to rinse in cold water afterwards. Purée the tomatoes with the spices.
3. In a pot with olive oil, sauté the meat, carrot, celery, and onions. Don't worry if the sausage escapes its casings. Add chopped mushrooms when the onions get transparent; add garlic when the mushrooms begin to darken. When the garlic becomes very aromatic, deglaze the pan with chicken stock dissolved in red wine.
4. Add the tomatoes to the pot, toss in some bay leaves, and let stew for a few hours. 
5. When the sauce has simmered to your taste, begin preparing the noodles. No rush. If using actual pasta, consider only parboiling them, since there will be plenty of liquid in the pasta itself, and crunchiness is fine.
6. Whisk an egg into the ricotta cheese. 
7. Layer the dish like so:
    a. Bottom-most: Meat sauce
    b. Ricotta-Egg Mix
    c. Basil
    d. Shredded Mozzarella
    e. Layer of noodles/zucchini 
    f. Meat and sauce
    g. Ricotta egg 
    h. Basil
    i. Layer of noodles
    j. Top-most: a mix of whatever isn't already used, but mostly parmesan and mozzarella to melt and caramelise on the surface. 
8. Since this dish is made up of pre-cooked ingredients, it doesn't need to actually bake; half an hour at 375°F will do the trick of melting the cheeses. Broil for five minutes before serving to get the top-most layer crispy. The longer this dish sits and congeals, the better.
