# Skyline Chili (Saltsa Kima with Noodles)

## Ingredients

Makes 2 quarts of Sauce

- Onions, diced (As many as you like)
- Garlic, pressed (As many as you like)
- 6 oz of tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Cinnamon
- 1/2 tbsp Paprika
- 1/4 tbsp Allspice
- 1/4 tbsp Ground Cloves
- 1/4 tbsp Oregano
- 1/4 tbsp Cumin
- Black Pepper, ground
- 1 cube beef stock
- Red Wine
- Cheddar, finely shredded
- Noodles / Zuchinni Noodles 
- 1.5 lb Ground Beef 

## Preparation

1. Thaw out the beef in advance. Add enough olive oil until it covers the bottom. Sauté the beef until browned on the outside. Remove and set aside. 

2. In the pot, sauté the onions until they turn clear, then add garlic and spices. Halt the frying with a splash of wine when the garlic turns golden.

3. Add tomato paste, beef stock, and beef. Add water until the sauce is the desired thickness (no more than 6 cups, authentic Cincinatti style is quite watery). Add cream or chocolate syrup if it gets too thin.

4. Simmer on low heat for 30 minutes to an hour. Stir occasionally.

1. Meanwhile, prepare noodles or zucchini. Spaghetti is the traditional noodle, but zucchini is a great no-carb alternative.

5. Shred cheddar cheese and dice fresh onions. Serve the sauce over the noodles with condiments on top.
