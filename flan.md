\section{\sf Ingredients}

For the appareil:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1200 millilitres Whole Milk
    \item 1 teaspoon Vanilla extract
    \item 50 grams sugar 
    \item 6 large eggs 
    \item 120 grams cornstarch
    \item an additional 200 grams sugar
    \item 300 grams heavy whipping cream
\end{itemize}

For Pâte Sablée:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 250 grams flour
    \item 100 grams butter
    \item 80 millilitres water
    \item pinch of salt 
\end{itemize}

Or use premade Pâte feuilletée (puff pastry sheets).

\section{\sf Preparation}

For the Custard: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pour milk into a large pot and mix in vanilla extract. Dissolve 50 grams sugar.  
    \item Meanwhile, in a metal bowl, whisk together the eggs, 200 grams sugar, and the corn starch. In a third bowl, measure out 300 grams of cream.
    \item Place milk-pot over medium-low heat, whisking constantly to prevent burning or overflowing.
    \item When the milk begins to boil, pour the milk mixture into the eggs. Whisk together immediately. Pour the combined mixture back into the large pot, and bring back to boil on medium heat. Stir constantly until the mixture stiffens into a proper custard.
    \item Remove custard from heat and add the 300 grams of cream. Whisk together and wait for it to cool to room temp.
    \item Cover it with saran wrap, making sure the surface of the custard is in contact with the plastic. Let it congeal in a refrigerator for minimum 1 hour, better overnight. 
    \item When ready to bake, use an immersion blender to stir the custard once more. Preheat the oven to 400°\textsc{f}.
\end{enumerate}

For Pâte Sablée:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and the cold butter. Using your hands, make a sand-like mixture of the butter and flour. Don't let the butter get to warm in your hands. 
    \item Add water and salt. Knead into a flaky dough.
    \item Form the dough into a ball, then it flat on a floured surface until it is a quarter inch thick. 
\end{enumerate}

Final Stage: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a circular cake mold, form the pâte to the sides and trim off any dough that overflows the rim. Pour in the custard, leaving a half centimeter gap between the surface and the rim for the custard to rise.
    \item Bake the tart for 25 to 30 minutes; raise the temperature to 450°F for an additional five minutes to brown the surface.
    \item Remove from the oven and let it cool down; when room temperature, bush simple syrup onto the surface. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
\end{enumerate}
