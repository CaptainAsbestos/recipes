\Huge \sc Crêpes Françaises

\large

This recipe serves three, but it makes several dozen crêpes. It requires a thin non-stick pan with a wide flat bottom. If you are able, flipping them in the pan is traditional, but you may require a spatula for flipping the crêpes. We found \textit{Fleur d'Oranger} at an Middle-Eastern Grocery store. It takes about 2 hours to complete, but you can start eating them while you make them.

# Ingredients

- 40 grams butter 
- 4 eggs 
- 250 grams of flour 
- 40 grams of sugar 
- 600 millitres of milk 
- 1 imperial tablespoon of \textit{Fleur d'Oranger}. 
- A pinch of salt

# Preparation 

## Batter

1. Add flour into a bowl. Make a crater in the centre, crack the eggs into the well, and pour your sugar and salt on the cracked eggs.
2. While whisking, add the milk a little at a time. Start at the centre and slowly spiral outwards with the whisk, so as to avoid clumping. 
3. Melt and add the butter and \textit{fleur d'oranger}. Stir in gently. The batter should be quite liquid.
4. Let rest in the refrigerator one hour.

## Frying 

1. Heat the pan very hot. Brush a very small amount of butter onto the pan. 
2. Whisk the batter briefly to remove bubbles, then ladle enough into the pan to cover the bottom. Lift the pan up and roll it around so as to spread the batter as thinly as possible. 
3. When the crêpe is starting to look slightly yellow on bottom, flip it and cook the other side. The second side takes half as long as the first to cook through. 
4. Remove the crêpe and serve fresh. Repeat the frying process, buttering the pan every other time you ladle one in. 


For toppings, white sugar and fresh lemon juice are my favourite. This is where you can experiment as much as you want. Roll the crêpes into cylinders or fold them into wedges.
