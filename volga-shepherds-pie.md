# \centering\sc\sffamily\huge Volga Shepherd's Pie

Time from start to serve: 45 minutes minimum.

\lettrine{\sffamily S}{ hepherd's} pie is known as a British dish, but this recipe combines the crispy potato top with a variant of the Volga German Kraut Bierocks, which is a savory meat filling with a touch of sourness to cut through the starch and fat. The proportions are inexact because the chef should prepare only as much as can fit in the casserole dish they use at the end. You will also need a non-stick frying pan of some kind; I also find that an electric whisk to be more efficient at mashing potatos than by hand.

\subsection{\sffamily\Large Ingredients}

For the Potatos:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gold Potatos, peeled
\item Garlic Cloves, peeled
\item Bay Leaves
\item Stock Cubes
\item Black Pepper, whole
\item Butter
\end{itemize}

For the Filling:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ground Beef or Sausage
\item Dill
\item Cabbage or Sauerkraut (if you use fermented cabbage, use sweet non-pickled onions)
\item Red Onions or Pickled Red Onions (if you use pickled onions, don't use sauerkraut)
\item Garlic Powder
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\sffamily\Large Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Peel the potatos and garlic. Get them boiling with the bay leaves, pepper, and stock. Let them boil until soft, no less than 15 minutes. Strain the solid bits out and save the stock if you want it for a stew later! 
\item While the potatos are boiling, brown your meat in a non-stick pan. When the meat is no longer pink, but not seared at all, add your non-fermented vegetables and garlic powder. When the meat starts to sear, add your sour veggies and dill, then turn the heat off. Spread the filling on the bottom of a ceramic oven-safe casserole dish.
\item When the potatos are done boiling, add a half stick of butter and mash them. Add as much butter as you need to get a fluffy texture, but don't overdo it. Spread the potatos in a half inch layer across the top of the filling. Save whatever spare potatos you have by freezing them for a later meal. 
\item Broil the potatos for 20 minutes in the oven. Serve hot.
