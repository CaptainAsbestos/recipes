\subsection{\sffamily\Large Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}

    \item 4 guajillo chiles or New Mexico chiles
    \item 2 chiles anchos 
    \item 1 chile arbol (optional, these are very piquant)
    \item savoury bouillon (I use "not-chick'n" cubes)
    \item sliced mushrooms (I use this in lieu of pork, some people use marinated jackfruit)
    \item Summer squash (when stewed long enough, it simulates the shredded pork texture)
    \item Vegetable Oil
    \item 1 tin of hominy 
    \item 6 cloves garlic 
    \item 1 diced tomato (or a little bit of tomato paste)
    \item \sfrac{1}{2} onion
    \item 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
    \item black pepper to taste
    \item 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
    \item 1 dash liquid smoke
    \item 3 bay leaves 
    \item chopped raddish
    \item shredded white cabbage or lettuce
    \item lime wedges
    \item cilantro
    \item diced red onions
    \item avocados
    \item warm corn tortillas or chips

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\sffamily\Large Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Soak the chiles in hot water for 15 minutes. Cut them open to remove the seeds and the stems. Purée them with the garlic, onions, and the water from the soaking. Strain the liquid from the chunks. (save the pulp to add later if you want it spicier)
    \item In a Dutch oven, add a few tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Sauté the mushrooms (or marinated jackfruit), squash, and onions until the onions are clear.
    \item Toast the cumin momentarily in the hot oils (no more than 30 seconds). Add the diced tomato, using its juice to deglaze the pot's bottom. When the tomatos smell cooked and not raw, pour in the chili sauce.
    \item Add enough water to cover the surface of the veggies. Add the bay leaves, oregano, black pepper, the liquid smoke, and the bouillon.
    \item Drain and rinse the the hominy, add to the broth, and simmer the stew at least sixty minutes (until the hominy becomes tender). At this point, add salt to taste. 
    \item Garnish with diced red onions, lime wedges, cilantro, avocados, cabbage, lettuce, or sliced raddishes. Serve hot.
