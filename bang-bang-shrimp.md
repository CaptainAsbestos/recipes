Recipe by Curry Trail

## Ingredients 

- 1 pound shrimps peeled and deveined
- 1 cup corn flour
- 1 cup buttermilk
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- Canola oil for deep frying
- Sauce 
    * 1 cup mayonnaise
    * 4 teaspoon Thai sweet chili sauce
    * 1 1/2 teaspoon sriracha or as per spice preference
    * 1 teaspoon honey optional
    * Dash of lime juice optional
- Green onions for garnish

## Instructions 

1. Remove the head and peel the shell. Devein and clean it thoroughly.
2. Using kitchen towel, pat dry shrimp completely.
    a. Your shrimp wont turn crispy as expected if you do not dry it completely.
3. Prepare flour mix but whisking corn flour, salt and pepper to taste.
    b. I like to season my batter for coating shrimp. If you are not particular about seasoning, skip it. Well seasoned shrimps are so much better than bland ones.
4. Prepare buttermilk but whisking in a dash of salt.
5. Soak cleaned and dry shrimp in buttermilk mix for about a minute. *DO NOT* marinate shrimp for longer. Shrimp will begin to cook in buttermilk if left longer.
6. Remove shrimp from buttermilk.
7. Coat it well in corn flour. Shake off excess flour.
    a. Use one hand to coat shrimp in liquid marinade and the other hand to coat in dry marinade. No more cakey hands!
8. Heat canola oil in a pan.
9. Deep fry shrimps in hot canoli oil for about 1 to 2 minutes on each sides or until golden brown.
    a. Fry shrimp in batches, do not crowd the pan.
10. Oil should be hot to get golden brown fried shrimp. Use thermometer in case you want to be safe. Heat up oil to 375 degrees, then start frying shrimps.
11. Remove fried shrimp from oil and place it on plate lined with kitchen paper to absorb excess oil.
12. Pour to your hearts content bang bang sauce over the shrimp, toss to coat evenly. You can drizzle the sauce over bang bang shrimp if you prefer it that way.
13. Top with fresh parsley, green onion or sesame seeds.
