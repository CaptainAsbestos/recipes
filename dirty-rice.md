# \centering\huge\sf \textsc{Cajun Dirty Rice}

\lettrine{\sf A}{lso} known as "rice dressing" in the Thanksgiving sense, this dish bears similarities to gumbos and jambalayas. Rather than preparing a roux and frying the veggie trinity in it, this recipe adds the flour at the end, and the added broth makes the rice "dirty" as the flour thickens and sticks to the other ingredients. Traditionally, it uses chicken liver and gibblets as a way to avoid wasting meat. Cooking in a standard 12-inch cast iron pan will yield between two and four servings. This recipe takes about 30 minutes to be edible, but will taste better if left to stew for an additional 15 minutes.

\section{\sf Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prepare rice with the bay leaves in a cooker or on the stove. Let it cook while you make the rest. 
    \item Dice the veggies and meat.
    \item In the cast iron pan over medium heat, fry the meat in hot oil. Remove from the pan when browned. 
    \item Saut√© the trinity (peppers, onions, celery) with the meat. You want the onion to be transparent and the celery to be limp. 
    \item When the veggies are fried enough, add the minced garlic and any other spices you wish. When you smell the garlic aroma turning roasty, move on to the next step.
    \item Add the rice (if it is ready) and stir it into the gravy. Add up to a quarter cup of flour, and coat the mixture in it. 
    \item Once the flour is thoroughly mixed in and beginning to fry, arrest the cooking by adding broth. Let the mixture simmer for 15 minutes, or until the liquid has boiled off. Serve garnished with parsley and chopped scallions.
