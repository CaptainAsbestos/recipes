# Noodles Carbonara

## Ingredients

- Noodles
    * This Recipe works great with fresh Zucchini 
- As much Bacon as you like
- 2 Yellow Onions
- 4 Eggs
- 4 cloves Garlic
- Cream (Optional)
- Black Pepper
- Gourmet Parmesan -- Get a nice nutty one

## Preparation

1. Boil Noodles (Sans salt) while preparing the rest.
2. Slice and dice the onions. 
3. Fry Bacon strips in Pan. Remove when they look fit to eat, drain the Bacon grease. (Save in separate container for other recipes)
4. Add olive oil to the pan and get fry the onions until they become clear.
5. Add garlic and cracked black pepper, and fry until garlic is golden. Deglaze the pan with pasta water to prevent garlic from burning.
6. Add the eggs and scramble them. Add paremsan and pasta water, stir them together to thicken the sauce. Reduce heat.
7. At this point, sample the sauce and determine if it is too salty. If so, add whipping cream and let it stew for a bit. If it isn't salty enough, bear in mind that the fried ham will introduce more saltiness. Let your guests add parmesan if they want more salt.
8. Crumble bacon back into the sauce and serve.
