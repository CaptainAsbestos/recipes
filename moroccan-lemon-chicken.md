by Christine Benlafguih for [The Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/moroccan-chicken-with-preserved-lemon-olives-2394669)

Prep 15 minutes, cook 90, serves 4

## Ingredients

- 1 chicken whole chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil, or a mix of vegetable oil and olive oil; or a mix of oil and butter
- 2 very large white or yellow onions, very thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley
- 2 to 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads, divided, optional
- For the Sauce:
    * 1/2 to 1 teaspoon smen (Moroccan preserved butter), optional
    * 1/4 cup green, red, or mixed olives
    * 1 preserved lemon, quartered, seeds removed

## Preparation

1. Ahead of time if possible, combine the chicken with the onion, garlic, herbs, and spices, including half of the saffron. (Reserve the rest of the saffron for adding to the sauce at a later time.) If time allows, cover and leave the chicken to marinate in the fridge for a few hours or even overnight. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

2. When ready to cook, transfer the chicken and onions (scrape every last bit out of your bowl) to a heavy-bottomed pot, deep skillet or Dutch oven. Cover and cook the chicken over medium or medium-low heat, gently stirring and turning the chicken every 15 minutes or so, until the chicken is tender enough to pinch off the bones. (This will take approximately one hour, but longer if using a free range chicken). Keep the heat adjusted so that the chicken doesn't scorch, and only add a little water if you feel you must. Typically the chicken will braise in its own juices.

3. When the chicken is cooked, carefully transfer it to a plate and cover.

4. Continue cooking the onion mixture and sauce over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquids evaporate and the onions can be mashed into a blended mass which separates from the oils. If your onions do not appear to be melding, you can give a few pulses with an immersion blender, but do not overprocess.

5. Add the preserved lemon, olives, the rest of the saffron, and a few tablespoons of water, and simmer gently for 5 to 10 minutes. Return the chicken to the pot to heat through, or place under the broiler to brown the skin.

6. Place the chicken on a serving platter, pour the onion sauce over the top and sides, and garnish the top of the chicken with the quartered lemon and some olives.

7. For casual meals, consider garnishing the chicken with a handful or two of french fries (patate frite), which may also be offered as a traditional side.

8. Moroccan tradition is to eat by hand, using crusty Moroccan bread for soaking up the sauce.
