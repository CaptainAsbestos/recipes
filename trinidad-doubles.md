\section{Preparation}

Bara Instructions

\begin{enumerate}
\item   In a medium bowl, add flour, baking powder, salt, yeast, turmeric and sugar.
\item   Add lukewarm water gradually and mix to form a very soft, slightlysticky dough. Do not over knead.
\item   Rub the dough with oil, cover and set aside to rest 1 hour (minimum) or until doubled(max 6 hrs or overnight). The longer it rests, the softer the bara--6 hours is perfect, but if you are in a hurry, 1 hr can work.
\item   Divide the dough into 16 balls. Cover and allow it to raise another hour or until doubled.
\item   Rub oil on a flat surface or plate. Place the dough on the oiled surface and flatten to a 6 inch round(oil hands as well) or almost transparent!! Make to your desired thickness and width--keeping in mind it puffs up as it cooks
\item   Meanwhile heat oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, gently place dough in hot oil and fry on each side until cooked and golden brown--takes seconds if the oil is hot enough. Drain on the side of the pot, using the spoon.
\item   Place the fried dough (bara) in paper towel or clean kitchen towel, stacking them on each other as they are done frying. This will allow them to flatten, steam and give them the soft, chewy texture we all love--just like the doubles man's! Repeat with the remaining dough. Serve hot with Doubles channa(recipe below).
\end{enumerate}

Channa Instructions

\begin{enumerate}
\item   Soak chickpeas overnight with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Drain and rinse with several changes of water. Drain again.
\item   In a pot, add about 6 cups of water and place over medium heat. Add channa, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and stir to combine. Bring to a boil and scoop out any impurities that rise to the top. Adding more baking soda than this will give it a weird metallic--baking powder taste.
\item   When chickpeas are tender, about 1 hour, add minced bandhania, minced garlic and turmeric and mix well. You can also add minced hot pepper.
\item   Continue to cook for 15-20 minutes or longer if required. During this time, with a wooden spoon, stir, moving back and forth motion to bring it to the right consistency. This will take several minutes for the channa to thicken, so be patient. Doubles will be ready soon!
\item   Taste for salt and add more if required. To finish, mix in bandhania, amchar massala or ground roasted cumin or a combination.
\item   Enjoy with the baras! Can be made ahead--a day before. Can be easily doubled.
\end{enumerate}

Chutney

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To make the cucumber chutney, mix all ingredients to combine. Taste and add salt and black pepper if required.
  \item To make the bandhania chutney, place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and pulse to combine. Add salt to your preference. You will need to add water if making it in a blender--just enough to combine
\end{enumerate}
