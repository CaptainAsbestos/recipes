# Pompkin Spice Fruit Cobbler

## Ingredients

### For the fruit filling 

- 4 to 7 cups of sliced fruit
- 0.5 to 1 cup packed brown sugar (optional)
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice (optional)
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch (optional)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons pompkin spice blend (optional):
    - 18 parts fresh ground cinnamon
    - 4 parts fresh ground nutmeg or mace
    - 4 parts pulverized ginger
    * 3 parts allspice
    * 3 parts fresh ground cloves

### Topping

- Flour, sugar, baking powder, salt
- 1.5 cups cream

## Equipment

- 8x8 inch baking pan, 9x9 inch baking pan, or 9 inch pie plate
- Measuring spoons and cups
- Baking sheet or aluminium foil to catch rips

## Preparation

1. Heat oven to 375Â° F. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven. Coat the baking dish with butter and set aside. 
2. Prepare the fruit -- wash, peel, stem, seed, \&c. Taste-test and mix in the optional ingredients as needed; use cornstarch to thicken juicy fruits or if you prefer a firmer cobbler. Mix in the pompkin spice blend.
3. Transfer the fruit to the baking dish. It should fill the dish halfway to three quarters full, leaving a good inch or so of extra space for the cobbler topping. 
4. Mix the dry ingredients for the topping in a large bowl.
5. Add the cream to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined; the dough will be quite wet. 
6. Scoop the cobbler mixture onto the fruit mixture. Using a small ice cream scoop or a spoon, scoop 2 tablespoon portions of the cobbler dough onto the fruit. 
7. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes. Brush the cobbler dough with 1 tablespoon cream and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Place the cobbler on a rimmed baking sheet to catch drips or put foil underneath. Bake until topping is golden brown around the edges and the fruit filling is bubbling. 
8. Cool the cobbler and serve a la mode.
