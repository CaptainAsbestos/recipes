Prep: 15 minutes
Cook: 60 Minutes
Serves 4

## Ingredients 

- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces and skin removed
- 2 large sweet white onions, or yellow onions, chopped
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
- 2 (2- to 3-inch) pieces cinnamon stick
- 1 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 to 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 cup (2 ounces) unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Preparation

1. Mix ingredients in a Dutch oven. Cover and cook on ***medium to med-high heat*** for ***1 hour*** or until the meat is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent burning; do not add water.
2. Reduce liquids until only oil remains. Discard the cinnamon sticks and taste the sauce for seasoning (salty and piquant is ideal).
