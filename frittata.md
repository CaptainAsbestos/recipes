# Frittata 

## Ingredients

- 12 eggs
- 3 tablespoons full-fat dairy
    * Heavy cream, milk, sour cream, crème fraîche or jogurt
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (4 oz) grated or crumbled cheese
- 3-5 cups chopped vegetables or greens
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Garnish: chopped or torn fresh, leafy herbs
    * such as Basil, parsley, cilantro, or dill

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 425° F for the traditional stovetop method, or 350 for the baked methods (casserole or mini/muffins).
2. Crack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl. Add your dairy of choice and the salt. Whisk just until the egg yolks and whites are blended. Whisk in all or half of the cheese (you can save the other half for topping the frittata before baking, if desired). Set the mixture aside.
3. In a 12 inch cast iron skillet (or any other large skillet which is oven safe), warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the vegetables, starting with chopped onions or other dense vegetables. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, then add any softer veggies such as zucchini. Cook until those vegetables are tender, then add any garlic or greens, and cook until fragrant or wilted. Season with salt to taste.

### Traditional stovetop option

Whisk the eggs once more and pour the mixture over the vegetables. Stir with a spatula briefly to combine and distribute the mixture evenly across the pan. If you reserved any cheese from before, sprinkle it on top now.

5. Once the outside edge of the frittata turns lighter in color (about 30 seconds to 1 minute), carefully transfer the frittata to the oven. Bake for 7 to 14 minutes (keep an eye on it), until the eggs are puffed and appear cooked, and the centre of the frittata jiggles just a pit when you shake it gently. Remove from oven and place it on a cooling rack. Garnish with herbs and serve.
