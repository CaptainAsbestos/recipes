This recipe requires a candy thermometer. Grease wax papers laid out on cookie sheets for spooning the candy out. Mind the sauce and do not let yourself get distracted.

\section*{Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Cook sugar, milk, \& Karo to soft-ball stage in a pot (between 235° and 245°F ) in a stainless steel pot. This will superconcentrate the sugar in the mixture. 
    \item When the soft-ball stage is reached, spoon out a small amount of candy into a clear glass filled with water. If the drops retain their shape as they sink and settle on the bottle, immediately remove the sauce from heat and place on a cool burner. Wait ten minutes. 
    \item Add one teaspoon vanilla extract and fold it into the sauce for 90 seconds. 
    \item Add the pecans, \textit{briefly} stir the mixture, and then \textit{immediately} spoon it out immediately onto your wax paper. It will crystallise rapidly and be ready to eat in minutes.
