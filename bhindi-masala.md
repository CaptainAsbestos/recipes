\section{Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item At this point, prepare your rice and let it cook while you make the sauce. 
    \item In a wide pan, add enough oil to cover the bottom and add the frozen okra before turning on heat. Turn to medium heat so that the okra thaws out without causing much splashing. Sauté on medium heat for at least 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. 
    \item Add enough oil to cover the pan again. Add cumin seeds. When they begin to sputter, add the onions and green chili. Sauté the onions until they are transparent.
    \item Add the ginger-garlic paste and stir in. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the garlic smells aromatic. 
    \item Add the chopped tomatoes to deglaze the pan. Sauté until they are mushy.
    \item Stir in chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and coriander. Sauté until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan. 
    \item Pour half a cup of water into the pan and stir well. Cook the masala until it thickens. You may also use bouillon or stock instead of plain water.
    \item Let this stew for 5 minutes, then add your fenugreek and okra. Cover and cook on low heat however long it takes for the okra to tenderize. Serve over rice.
