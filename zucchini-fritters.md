# Zucchini Fritters

## Ingredients

- 3 cups shredded zucchini
- 3/4 cup of chickpea flour (you can use wheat flour if not available)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon tahini
- salt
- black pepper (to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon dill
- 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
- diced chives
- olive oil 

## Preparation 

1. Shred zucchini. Sprinkle salt over the shreds to move water out by osmosis.
2. Add flour, pepper, and dill together in a large mixing bowl to make the breading. Mix in zucchini. 
3. In a separate, small bowl, add tahini and lemon juice. Mix together until it forms a thinner paste. 
4. Add tahini-lemon mixture to the breaded shreds and stir. 
5. Add olive oil to a skillet on medium-high heat.
6. Scoop the fritters out onto the hot oil and smush with a spatula to ensure even cooking. 3-4 minutes on each side or until the desired level of crispiness.
7. Serve with tzaziki sauce.
