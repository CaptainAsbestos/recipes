# \centering\sc\sffamily\huge Seitan Buffalo Wings

\lettrine{\sffamily S}{\sffamily eitan} is the Japanese name for a wheat-gluten based meat-alternative developed by East Asian vegetarians. It has the texture of duck. This recipe takes about 2 hours from start to finish, but most of the waiting time is spent waiting for the ingredients to soak passively. It makes less than a kilogram of seitan, which seems little but consider the cost alternative of buying at the store. I also found that homemade seitan tastes better.

\subsection{\sffamily\Large Preparation}

Making the Seitan:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mix the flour with the 600 ml of cold water and knead it for 10 minutes until it forms a dough. Immerse the dough in cold water and let sit at least one hour. The starch in the flour will seap out by osmosis; we only want the gluten in the flour.
    \item Drain the water and immerse the dough once again in fresh cold water. Knead and fold the dough into itself to press out the remaining starch. Discard the water every ten minutes and continue kneading with fresh water. Repeat this process six times, or until the water is cloudy and not milky. 
    \item Let the dough sit for ten minutes more in the water while you prepare the bouillon. Alternatively, you can let the seitan soak as long as you wish at this stage. Continue with the next step once the broth is prepared and heating up.
    \item Flatten the seitan out on the counter. With a butter knife, cut the seitan for braiding – as if you were making a pair of pants with three legs. Braid the strands together, and tie them in the middle and off at the end. Then, knot the long braid into itself.
    \item Once the broth comes to boil, lower the braided dough into it.
\end{enumerate}

Making the broth:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add the spices to the water in a stock pot. While you wait for the broth to boil, return to step four above and braid the seitan.
    \item When the broth begins to boil, add the seitan. Let it stew for 20 minutes, then flip it over so the other side gets a good exposure: 40 minutes total.
\end{enumerate}

When the seitan is done stewing, slice it however you wish. Coat the sides in flour and sauté them in hot oil. Combine melted butter with hot sauce for a quick and dirty buffalo sauce. Serve with sliced celery and ranch. 

You may also freeze the stewed seitan for later use.
