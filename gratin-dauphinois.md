# \centering\huge\sf Gratin Dauphinois


\lettrine{T}{his} recipe comes from Savoie, where dairy and potatos are found in abundance. Think of it as a dish ideal for baking in a cabin while a blizzard rages outside: it can cook as long as you want, and will only taste better for it. In a real Gratin Dauphinois, there is neither cheese nor egg; if you do, it's simply known as potatos au gratin. This recipe serves six as a side; it goes well with steak. Preparation time is quick, but the gratin must bake for around 90 minutes. This is also a recipe which tastes better the day after it's made.

\section{\sf Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre-heat oven to 350Â°\textsc{f}. Place a layer of tin foil on the lower rack to catch any spills.
    \item Peel the potatos; slice them about a quarter inch thick. Pour salt on them and massage it in.
    \item Smash the garlic and rub its juices on the bottom of a casserole dish. When done rubbing, mince it.
    \item Mix the cream, milk, garlic in a bowl. Crack black pepper and scratch fresh nutmeg into the liquid.
    \item Lay the potatos in a casserole dish. Pour the liquid mix over them until the potatos are submerged. The potatoes should absorb some moisture.
    \item Bake the gratin for at least 90 minutes. If desired, bake it longer at a lower temperature. When it is crispy and golden on top, it's finished.
\end{enumerate}
