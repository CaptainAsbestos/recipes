# Pinoy Pork Belly

from [Speedy Recipe](https://speedyrecipe.com/grilled-pork-belly/)

Prep time 6-24 hours, cook time 30 minutes. Serves four.

## Ingredients:

- 2 lbs sliced pork belly, in 3/4 inch wide strips

Marinade:

- 7 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 1 lemon's juice
- 0.25 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 4 cloves crushed garlic
- 4-6 tablespoons banana ketchup (aka 3oz or half a cup)
- 1 tablespoon canola oil

Basting sauce:

- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons banana ketchup
- Half a Lemon's juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar

## Preparation

1. Combine all the marinade ingredients together in mixing bowl. Stir until they're all blended.
2. Placing the pork belly in the marinade, coat the meat and let sit in a refrigerator for 6 hours minimum. 24 is the optimum.
3. Prepare the basting sauce in a separate bowl, mixing well.
4. When the meat is ready, preheat grill. Grill each strip on one side for 3-4 minutes, flipping over and basting for another three minutes until completely cooked.

Serve with pickled papaya and rice (or use this as the protein in Vietnamese Bún, it's basically the same thing).
