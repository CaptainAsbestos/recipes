from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222667/dal-makhani-indian-lentils/)

## Ingredients

Makes six servings.

- 1 cup dried Lentils, soaked 12 hours.
    * 1/4 cup dried kidney beans (optional)
- 5 cups water
- 1 cup canned tomato pur√©e (or more to taste)
- 1/4 cup butter 
- 0.5 cup cream or Joghurt
- 2 tablespoons ghee (substitute vegetable oil to make it vegan)
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- First spice blend 
    * 6 whole cloves
    * 4 black cardamom pods
    * 4 bay leaves
    * 1 stick cinnamon, broken
* Second spice blend
    * 1.5 tablespoons garlic paste
    * 1.5 tablespoons ginger paste
    * 0.5 teaspoons ground turmeric
    * Cayenne pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons ground coriander
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 tablespoons fenugreek 
* Salt to taste

## Preparation

**IMPORTANT**: Soak Lentils overnight!

1. Soak legumes in a large bowl, covered in plenty of water, for 12 hours. Drain when ready to cook.
2. Cook legumes in 5 cups of saline on ***medium*** heat until tender (ca. 1 hour). Remove from heat and set aside; keep the legumes and water in the pot for later use.
3. Heat the cooking oil in a sauce pan on ***medium high*** heat. Add the cumin seeds to the oil; when they pop, the oil is hot enough to proceed (ca. 2 minutes). Add cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, and cloves; cook until bay leaves turn brown (ca. 60 seconds). Immediately reduce the heat to ***medium-low***. Add ginger, garlic, turmeric, and cayenne pepper and stir. 
4. Stir tomato puree into the spices; cook on ***medium-heat*** until the sauce reduces (ca. 5 minutes). Add chili powder, coriander, and butter; stir until butter is melted.
5. Add the legumes and water into the mix; bring to boil and reduce heat to ***low***. Add the fenugreek, cover and let simmer for 45 minutes. Stir occasional. Add cream if desired.
