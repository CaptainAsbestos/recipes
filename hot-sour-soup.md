# Hot \& Sour Soup

## Ingredients

Makes a gallon of soup. Cook time 3 hours. Proportions are to taste.

- Shiitake Mushrooms 
- Wood Ear Mushrooms
- Extra Firm Tofu
- Bamboo Shoots
- Scallions
- Eggs
- Rice Vinegar
- Sesame Oil
- Soy Sauce
- Chicken Stock
- Garlic Paste
- Ginger Paste
- Cilantro 
- Black Pepper
- Baby Bok Choy (Optional)
- Tomatoes (Optional)
- 6 cups of water

## Preparation

1. Bring slightly-salted water to boil for flash-boiling the bok choy. Wash the greens to remove any dirt; cut them to your desired size. Prepare an ice bath for the bok choy. Rehydrate the dried mushrooms. Slice the Tofu into cubes. 
2. Add the greens to the boiling water for 10 seconds. Immediately drain them and toss the greens into the ice water. This should make them extra tender. Blanch the tomatoes.
3. Cover the bottom of a soup pot with canola oil, and heat on ***medium-high***. Add the scallions and garlic paste. When fragrant, add the chicken stock, bok choy, and ginger paste.
4. When the pot begins to simmer again, add the fungi, tofu, and bamboo shoots. Add any liquid from those three into the soup. 
5. At this point, sample the stew to make sure it tastes right. Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, and black pepper to your desired proportions.
6. Prepare the egg drop: In a medium bowl, whisk eggs with 2 teaspoons water and remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Remove pot from heat, then very slowly stream in whisked egg mixture around the edge of the pot. Cover the pot and let stand for 4 minutes, until the egg sets and floats to the surface. Drizzle in sesame oil and very gently stir to combine.
7. Let the soup simmer for up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with cilantro and serve.
