30 minutes from start to serve, makes 6 sandwiches

## Ingredients 

### The Sauce

- 16 oz Lager
- 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons corn starch
- 0.5 cups port wine
- 0.25 cups milk
- 1 cube chicken stock
- 1 bay leaf
- salt and pepper

### The Sandwhich

- Wonderbread-style sliced bread (don't use fancy bread)
- Roast beef
- Black Forest Ham
- Melty Cheese (such as Butterkäse)
- Iberian Sausage, such as Chouriço or Linguiça
    * Gaspar's is available at US grocery stores such as Publix
    * Mexican Chorizo or cajun spicy sausages work in a pinch
- Eggs

## Preparation

### Sauce First (takes 30 minutes)

1. Mix the corn starch with the lager while its still cold (to prevent clumping).
2. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a heavy bottom pot on **high heat.** Stir to prevent clumping.
3. When the gravy begins to boil, reduce to **medium heat**. Let simmer for 30 minutes. Keep an eye on it to prevent clumps or overboiling.

### While the sauce cooks,

1. Slice the sausages lengthwise, fry in olive in a pan. If it gets burned black, don't worry, that's the flavour! Add the drippings to the sauce when done. 
    a. While the sausage is frying, get your oven broiling at 500°F.
2. Arrange the roast beef, ham, and cheese on the bread. Toast the assembly in the oven until the cheese is melted. Use a toaster if you have one.
3. Peel the sandwiches apart and insert fried sausage. Turn off broiler but place the sandwiches inside to keep them warm. 
4. Just before serving, n the sausage pan fry one egg per sandwich. Sunny side up is optimal, just ensure that the **yolk remains runny**. 
5. Place eggs yolk down on top of the sandwich, then pour gravy over the top. Serve with fork and knife.
