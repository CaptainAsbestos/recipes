Serves 4.

### Ingredients 

For the Shrimp Marinade:

- Juice of 3 limes 
- zest of 1 lime
- 2 tbsp chopped cilantro (use however much you want)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 tsp. Cumin
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt
- 1 pound of peeled shrimp

For the Creamy Sauce:

- 1/2 cup Mayo or Mexican Crema
- 2 tbsp. hot sauce
- zest of 1 lime
- 1/2 tsp. garlic, freshly minced
- salt
- Honey, to taste.
- (optional) Half a white onion, finely shredded.

### Preparation

1. Thaw out shrimp in cold water. While they thaw, prepare the sauce.
2. For the sauce, mix the ingredients together. Taste-test it and adjust the flavours as needed.
3. Mix the Shrimp marinade together in a container.
4. When the shrimp have thawed out (they feel soft, not frozen solid), add them to the marinade. Let sit in the fridge for 20 minutes. 
5. While the shrimp marinate, toast some corn tortillas. Slice some lettuce for the tacos.
6. Strain the shrimp from the marinade and set the marinade aside. Fry the shrimp in a wok with hot oil. 2-3 minutes on each side or until they turn slightly pink. 
7. After the shrimp are fried, deglaze the pan with the marinade. This makes a tasty sauce which goes great with the Mayo/Crema.
8. Build tacos and serve.
