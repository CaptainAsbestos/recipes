## Ingredients

- Chicken Stock
- Seafood Stock
- Shrimp
- Andouille Sausage
- Celery
- White Onions
- Bell peppers 
- 0.5 - 2/3 cup of flour
- Vegetable oil
- Thyme and Sage
- Green onions
- File Powder
- Parsley
- Okra
- Rice (or steamed cauliflower)
- White Pepper (to taste)
- Cayenne Pepper (To Taste)

## Preparation

1. Bring water to boil in a non-stick pot. Add the stock cubes, sliced sausage, sage and thyme. If you have to peel your shrimp, add the shells to the stock for flavour.
2. Slice the key vegetables in advance and have them ready to go.
3. Get vegetable oil hot on a large cast iron skillet, over medium heat. Add the flour and stir gently. The centre of the pan will be the hottest, so make sure to keep shoving the roux towards it. Use your nose and your eyes to determine how dark you want the roux -- blonde will be thicker in the end product, but a dark chocolate coloured roux will have the best flavour. Add oil if the paste becomes too stiff to move fluidly. 
4. Once the roux is a nice peanut-butter to chocolate colour, add the three vegetables and turn the heat off. Add as much vegetables as can safely fit in the pan; any extra can go in the stock. Stir so that the sauce covers the vegetables; let the hot pan coast its heat off. When the veggies are sticking together like a gummy ball, that's when its done. Add it to the stock and stir it in. Cook it slow and low; stir every 20 minutes. 
5. Taste the stock to check its flavour. If the stock isn't smokey enough, add a few drops of liquid smoke. The smoke flavour will always diminish over time.
6. Let the stockpot go for as long as you wish, and let the shrimp thaw.
7. An hour before serving, bring the stockpot to boil. Prepare rice in a separate pot. Throw the shrimp, green onions, and okra in at the same time, stir constantly or else the okra will burn. 
9. Add Fil√© and serve.
