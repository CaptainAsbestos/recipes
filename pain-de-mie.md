\section{Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mix water, milk, yeast, and honey in a microwave safe bowl or cup. Microwave for 30 seconds. 
    \item In a mixing bowl, combine flour with salt. Add the liquid mix to the powder. Knead for 10 minutes. 
    \item Add melted butter and knead it in. If it's still too sticky, add the spare flour. Let the dough rest in an oiled bowl for at at least 45 minutes (but no more than 60 minutes). The idea is to wait for the dough to rise until doubled in size.
    \item Punch down the dough to remove the air. Knead it for an additional 5 minutes. Flatten it lengthwise, then roll the dough into a cylinder.
    \item Oil your bread pan. Place the dough in the pan for 30 minutes. 
    \item While you wait, pre-heat the oven to 482°F. 
    \item Place the dough in the middle rack. Immediately lower the temperature to 392°F.
    \item Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top is golden. 
    \item When the loaf is ready, you can brush some butter onto the top to give it a shine. Let the loaf rest at least 30 minutes before cutting it.
