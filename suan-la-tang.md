- 1 red chile, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
- 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- 3 tbsp. Sriracha
- 1 tsp. granulated sugar
- 1 medium carrot, thinly sliced
- 1 c. sliced shiitake mushrooms
- 1 c. enoki or seafood mushrooms
- 5 c. low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 1/2 c. thinly sliced bamboo shoots
- 6 oz. soft tofu, cut into Â½" cubes
- 1/3 c. rice wine vinegar
- 3 tbsp. Chinese black vinegar
- 3 tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp. ground white pepper
- 1 tsp. cornstarch
- 2 large eggs (optional)
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- Chili oil, for serving
- Cilantro, for serving

## Preparation

1. In a large bowl, soak yuba in 4 cups of cold water for 2 hours. In another large bowl, soak wood ear with 4 cups of cold water for 1 hour. Rinse and drain yuba and wood ear once rehydrated, then slice into thin slivers.
2. In a large pot over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add garlic, ginger, green onions, chile, and salt. Stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in Sriracha, sugar, yuba, wood ear, and mushrooms and cook until softened, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add in broth, bamboo shoots, and tofu, and bring to a simmer. Add in vinegars, soy sauce, and white pepper, and stir gently to combine. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water until smooth, then add cornstarch slurry to pot. Reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Optionally, make egg drop addition: In a medium bowl, whisk eggs with 2 teaspoons water and remaining 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil. Remove pot from heat, then very slowly stream in whisked egg mixture around the edge of the pot. Cover the pot and let stand for 4 minutes, until the egg sets and floats to the surface. Drizzle in sesame oil and very gently stir to combine.
5. Garnish with chili oil, cilantro, more green onions, and red chiles before serving.
