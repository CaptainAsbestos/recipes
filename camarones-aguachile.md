Prep 25 minutes, 30 minutes cooking, makes 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 pound extra large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup fresh squeezed Lime Juice (ca. 8 limes)
- 4 to 6 serrano peppers, stems removed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt to Taste
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 medium cucumber, peeled \& thinly sliced
- 4 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
- Black pepper to taste
- 8 corn tortilla tostadas
- 1 or 2 avocados, sliced

## Preparation

1. Peel and clean the shrimp. Butterfly the shrimp open and slice them open to increase surface area for marination.
2. Rinse the shrimp in cold water, pat dry, and place in shallow glass dish. Add half of the lime juice or enough to cover the shrimp. Season with salt to taste. Cover and chill while you proceed. 
3. Add serrano peppers, half the cilantro, olive oil, and remaining lime juice to a blender. Salt to taste. Blend on high until it reaches the desired consistency. Give it a taste to make sure the salinity is where you like it. When so, pour it over the shrimp and lime marinade, mixing evenly. Season with cracked pepper.
4. Layer the  cucumbers and onions on top. Add cilantro, cover and chill for 15 more minutes. The shrimp will be safe-to eat within 30 minutes, but theres no harm in letting it sit longer. Mix it all together, garnish with avocado slices and remaining cilantro. Serve with the tostados.

N.B.: Simmer the shrimp in salt water for three minutes after marinating if you're worried about the shrimp. Throw it in an ice bath to stop the shrimp from cooking itself. Let the shrimp set for 2 hours maximum, but if it goes longer it's still edible -- but as pickled shrimp!
