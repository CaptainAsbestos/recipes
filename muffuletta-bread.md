# Muffuletta Style Bread

## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water (110째F)
- 1 tbsp activated Dry Yeast
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 cup bread flour
- 1.5 teaspoon iodized salt
- (Optional) 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening
- Sesame Seeds
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

For the Egg wash:

- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons cold water

## Preparation

### Baking the bread

1. Combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar in the workbowl of a stand-mixer. Stir well and let stand for 5-10 minutes or until good and foamy. Meanwhile, Combine the flours, salt, and lard (optional) in a bowl and work in the fat until broken up unto very small pieces.
2. When the yeast mix is foamy, fit the mixer with the dough hook attachment and gradually add the flour on low speed until it is all incorporated. Scrape the sides down between additions. 
3. When the dough comes together, turn it onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, ca. 5-10 minutes, adding more flour is necessary.
    a. Alternatively, let the machine do the work, but kneading to the right consistency is sometimes more precise by hand.
4. Coat a large bowl in olive oil, then put the dough in, turning once to coat all sides. Cover loosely with a clean, dry towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 60-90 minutes, when it has doubled its bulk.
5. After the dough has risen, punch it down and shape it it into a flat round about 9 inches across (it will expand to 10"). Place the dough on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle the top with sesame seeds (2-3 tablespoons) then press them lightly into the surface. Loosely cover the loaf and let rise again until doubled in bulk, another 60 minutes or so. Preheat an oven to 425째F.
6. When the dough has risen again, remove the cover, gently brush the egg wash over it. Place the bread in the over and bake for 10 minutes at 425째F. Then turn the heat down to 375째F and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
